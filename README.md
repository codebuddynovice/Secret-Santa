⚙️ How It Works

1. Load participants (names + emails) from the script or an external file.
2. Randomly pair participants ensuring **no one is assigned themselves**.
3. Use Gmail’s SMTP server to send each participant an email revealing their giftee.
4. Optionally log all assignments for the organizer.

⚙️ Setup & Configuration

1️⃣ Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
No external packages are required for basic functionality.

2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project folder:

```env
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SENDER_EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

💡 *For Gmail accounts with 2FA, use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).*

3️⃣ Add Participants

Inside `secret_santa.py`, list your participants in this format:

```python
participants = {
    "Alice": "alice@example.com",
    "Bob": "bob@example.com",
    "Charlie": "charlie@example.com"
}
```

4️⃣ Run the Script

```bash
python secret_santa.py
```

Each participant will receive an email with their assigned recipient.
